## Web Development API Task

##### Your task is to create an API to manage a user persistence layer.

We would expect this task to take a few hours, however there is no strict time limit and you won't be judged on how long it took you to complete. Please find a few pointers below:

* Your solution must expose a user model and it's reasonable to expect that an individual user would have the following attributes:

	**id** - *A unique user id*  
	**email** - *A users email address*  
	**forename** - *A users first name*  
	**surname** - *A users last name*  
	**created** - *The date and time the user was added*

* It must have the ability to persist user information for at least the lifetime of the test.

* You API must expose functionality to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) models.

Although the main outcomes of the task are listed above, if you feel like you want to go that extra mile and show us what you're capable of, here is a list of potential enhancements that we have come up with:

* How your API is to be consumed (a custom interface or something like Google Chrome's "Postman" or Swagger).
* Use of an industry standard data exchange format.
* Sanitization checks of inputs.
* Implementation of test coverage.

Alternatively if you can think of any other features that you feel would further enhance your API, then we'd love to see what you can come up with!
